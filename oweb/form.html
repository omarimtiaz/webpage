With the recent discovery of Dwarka the Legendary City of Bhagavan Sri Krishna as recor
ded in many ancient Vedic scriptures such as Mahabharata and Bhagavata Purana; archaeologists an
d historians have been forced to accept that the ancient Sanskrit Vedic Scriptures are factual histo
ries of ancient India. However, rather than study these ancient texts they continue to persist in th
eir erroneous speculations. Unfortunately they cannot enter into this vast ocean of knowledge due to 
their own gross ignorence, and unfortunately they will not listen to those who can. The Aryans who 
worship Lord Sri Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead were well acquainted with space travel,
 as there was constant universal coming and going between all the planets in our solar system and beyond. 
 The mundane scientists cannot grasp the fact that there is Elemental existence; on this planet, as well as others, t
 hat is to say that intelligent lifeforms exists in subtle energy! There are subtle entities who's bodies are composed of 
 all the known elements, Earth, Fire, Water, Air, Ether, and more Subtle elements Mind, Intelligence, and False ego. The Vedas are full o
 
f narrations of such space travel and the nature of life on other planets. UFO does not necessarily mean of alien origin, 
but the fact that this and many other forms of advanced technology were prevelant on earth so long ago opens up a whole new
 line of research for all those who are interested in finding the truth. If ufologists really want to understand alien existence 
 they would do well to study the ancient Vedas, in particular Srimad Bhagavatam, which was specifically compiled for the peoples of this age! The narrat
ion of the event described in this video can be studied by following this link.
